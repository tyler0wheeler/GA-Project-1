        <h1>Condiments Race Time!!</h1>
          <p>It's the 5th inning here at Camden Yards and you know what time it is! Place your bets as Ketchup, Mustard, and Relish race to find out who we crown King of the Condiments!.</p>
          <p>Before the race begins, bet how many hotdogs you stand to win or lose depending on the outcome of the race </p>
          <p>If your player wins, you double your bet! Lose and you lose it! Each round place a new bet based on how many hotdogs you have! The winner is the first to 10 hotdogs! Lose them all and you lose! Good luck!  </p>
