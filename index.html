          <p>It's the 5th inning here at Camden Yards and you know what time it is! Place your bets as Ketchup, Mustard, and Relish race to find out who we crown King of the Condiments!.</p>
          <p>Before the race begins, place your bets on who you think will make it around the bases first! </p>
